# Project Name

## Description

This project is a modern web application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It leverages the power of server-side rendering provided by Next.js to deliver a fast, efficient, and SEO-friendly user experience. The application is styled with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, and uses ARK UI and ShadcnUI for additional UI components.

## Live Demo

You can view the live version of this project at [https://e-booking-eight.vercel.app/](https://e-booking-eight.vercel.app/). This version of the project is hosted on Vercel and is the production build of the application.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/project.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd project`
3. Install dependencies with pnpm: `pnpm install`
4. Start the development server: `pnpm run dev`

The application will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can use it by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser and exploring its features.

## UI Libraries

This project uses the following UI libraries:

-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
-   [ARK UI](https://ark-ui.com/): A modern, comprehensive UI library.
-   [ShadcnUI](https://ui.shadcn.com/): A UI library that provides a set of high-quality React components.

Each library has its own set of components and styles that can be used to build the user interface of the application.

## Project Structure

This project has a specific structure to organize the code in a logical and understandable way:

-   `lib`: This folder contains global and generic utilities, such as types and functions that are used throughout the application.

-   `components`: This folder contains all the React components used in the application. It has a subfolder `ui` which contains base components that are used to build more complex components.

-   `types`: Each component has its own types and interfaces, which are stored in their own files within the component's folder. This ensures good separation of concerns and makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

-   `services`: This folder contains code for asynchronous operations and functionalities. It includes interactions with the "server" and storage.

This structure helps to keep the codebase clean, organized, and easy to navigate.

## React Components

This project uses functional components in React. Here's a brief overview of how they are structured and used:

-   **Function Components**: All components in this project are function components. They are easier to read and test because they are plain JavaScript functions without state or lifecycle-methods.

-   **Server-side Rendering**: Static components are rendered on the server for better performance and SEO. Dynamic components are rendered as hybrids - they are initially rendered on the server, and then "hydrated" on the client with additional interactivity.

-   **State and Hooks**: State variables and hooks are initialized at the beginning of the component functions. This makes it easy to see what state and effects a component has at a glance.

-   **useEffect**: `useEffect` hooks are placed after the state and hooks initialization. This ensures that all the state variables and hooks are defined before they are used.

-   **Functions and Derived State**: Functions and derived state are placed after `useEffect`. This helps to keep the component code organized and easy to follow.

-   **Custom Hooks**: For components with complex logic, custom hooks are used. This helps to abstract the logic out of the components, making them easier to understand and test.

-   **Avoiding Prop Drilling**: In this project, we avoid prop drilling by using Jotai atoms and the composition model in React. Instead of passing data down through multiple layers of components (which is known as "prop drilling"), we store the data in Jotai atoms. Any component that needs the data can subscribe to the atom, regardless of where it is in the component tree. This makes the data flow in the application easier to understand and manage.

    Additionally, we use the composition model in React to create flexible components. Instead of passing components as props, we use them as children. This allows us to create more flexible and reusable components.

This structure and organization of components helps to keep the codebase clean, maintainable, and easy to understand.

## State Management

This project uses [Jotai](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai) for state management. Jotai is a simple, lightweight, and flexible state management library for React.

Jotai takes a unique "atoms" approach to state management. In Jotai, an atom represents a piece of state. Components can subscribe to atoms and automatically re-render when those atoms change. Atoms can be read from, written to, and can also be derived from other atoms.

This makes state management in the application straightforward and efficient. It allows for fine-grained control over state updates, which can lead to better performance in large applications.

Here's an example of how Jotai is used in this project:

## Testing

This project uses [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end testing. To run the tests, use the following command:

pnpm cypress
